The Gathering of Blessings: A Guru Yoga
by Jamyang Khyentse Chökyi Lodrö

rangsem tröpa dralwa la
In my own mind, free from conceptual elaboration,
rang ngoshepé kyab su chi
With a recognition of its very essence, I take refuge.
marik trulpé ma nam kün
All my past mothers, deluded and lacking awareness,
dömé sa la göpar gyi
I vow to establish in in the primordial state.

a, rangnang dakpa ying kyi khar
A.  In the pure, sky-like space of my own perception,
rangrig trodu dralwa yi
My own self-knowing awareness is neither scattered nor withdrawn,
riktsal magak chiryang char
And the unobstructed energy of pure awareness manifests as anything at all―
khordé künkhyab sishyi pal
Pervading  all saṃsāra and nirvāṇa, it is the splendour of existence and peace,
riktong dzinmé long du a
Aware yet empty, free from grasping, within this vast expanse: A.

This naked ordinary awareness that is present right now, unaltered and unfabricated―the uncompounded
empty clarity of rigpa―is the wisdom mind of the glorious lama. Decide on this with
certainty and sustain it in experience.

Written at the request of Lama Mardril who possesses the three higher trainings.
