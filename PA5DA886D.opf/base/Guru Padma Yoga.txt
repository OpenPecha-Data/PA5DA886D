Guru Padma Yoga
by Jamyang Khyentse Chökyi Lodrö

emaho
Emaho!
rangnang dakpé dün kha ru
Before me, in the space of my own pure perception,
tsawé lama pema jung
My root guru appears as Guru Padma,
kyab kündüpé daknyi la
Embodiment of all sources of refuge,
nying né soldeb jingyi lob
And I offer heartfelt prayer: inspire me with blessings!
kyen ngen barché shyiwa dang
Pacify obstacles and adversity.
samdön tamché yishyin drub
Cause all my wishes and aspirations to be fulfilled.
dümin chiwé mitsuk shing
Preserve me from untimely death.
di dang chima tamché du
Let me be guided and cared for by the Guru
gurü jesu zung du sol
In this and all my lives to come.
Prayer
Recite “Outwardly, you are the bodhisattva lord Chökyi Lodrö...etc.” a suitable number of times.
chitar gyalsé chökyi lodrö jé
Outwardly, you are the bodhisattva lord Chökyi Lodrö,
nangtar jampal drimé shenyen shyab
Inwardly, you are Mañjuśrī and Vimalamitra,
sangwa tsen dzok heruka pal la
Secretly, you are the Glorious Heruka with perfect attributes,
solwa deb so dak gyü jingyi lob
I pray to you: bless my mind, inspire my understanding!

Then for the recitation repeat the siddhi mantra as many times as possible.
om ah hung benza guru pema siddhi hung
oṃ āh hūṃ vajra guru padma siddhi hūṃ
At the end:
lama ö shyu rang la tim
The guru melts into light and dissolves into me.
yermé jingyi lab par gyur
And, inseparable, I receive the blessings.
With this, rest in the natural state. Finally dedicate the virtue and recite verses of auspiciousness.

Thus, Chökyi Lodrö wrote this in response to a request from Jigme Trinlé. May virtue and excellence
flourish!
